# Online_Shopping
 
Online shopping is a form of electronic commerce which allows consumers to directly buy goods or services from a seller over the Internet using a web browser. Here we have developed an Online Shopping System with the help of HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, PHP, BOOTSTRAP for Frontend and MySQL in the Backend.

In this Shopping System the Admin of the System can add different Categories in the System and he/she can also add different products under that particular category.
